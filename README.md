# Image Editor

A simple image manipulator for Android

## Development Setup

Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and set up an Android Emulator.

(If not cloned already, use the Android Studio launcher to clone the github repository and open it up)

Set up a virtual android studio emulator with minimum API 34 (Pixel 8 Pro API 34 was used, with additional tests with a physical Pixel 8)

# How to use the App 

Once you have set up the app you can run it on your computer using the emulator.

Once the app is running you will push the button that says "Upload Image".
* Select an image that you would like to edit (once you select an image it will bring you to the second screen).

On this page you can 
* Move the sliding bar to the right to blurr the image (you can pull it slighty right for a light blurr and the further right you go the more blurry the image looks).
* Select the "Invert" switch to invert the colors of your image.
* Select the "Flip X" button to flip your image over the X axis.
* Select the "Flip Y" button to flip your image over the Y axis.

Once you have selected the features that you would like to apply push the "Apply" button.
